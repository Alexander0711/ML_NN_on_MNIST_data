First attempt with a Neural Network to predict the MNIST data.

Simple approach with a neural network to be able to predict the MNIST data. 
In addition, the numbers should be displayed graphically and the probabilities should be shown in an array. 
This approach was the basis for a Kaggle competition.


MNIST data from this source were used:
